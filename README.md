My Geeklets
===========
This is my repo for the geeklets I use.

What's a geeklet?
-----------------
It's a tiny script run by a Mac OS X app called GeekTool, made by [Link to his site](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/ "Yann Bizeul")  [Link to his SO profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/318858/yann-bizeul "Stack Overflow profile")

	In the words of Yann:
		" Geek Tool is a file plugin to monitor MacOS X activity with /var/log/system.log, or any file that you want to follow. Shell mode to launch custom scripts or commands like "df" to check space left on filesystems or "uptime" to monitor load on your machine. Finally, image mode helps you monitor bandwith usage, CPU load, memory availability on your server with tools like MRTG or RRD. "
