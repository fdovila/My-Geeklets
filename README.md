My Geeklets
===========
This is the repo for the geeklets I use.

What's a geeklet?
-----------------
It's a tiny script run by a Mac OS X app called GeekTool, made by [Yann Bizeul (Site)](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/ "Link to his site")  [, also you can check his Stack Overflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/318858/yann-bizeul "Link to his SO profile")

	In the words of Yann:
		" Geek Tool is a file plugin to monitor MacOS X activity with   
		/var/log/system.log,  or  any  file  that you want to follow.   
		Shell mode to launch custom  scripts or commands like "df" to   
		check space left on filesystems  or "uptime" to  monitor load   
		on  your  machine.  Finally,  image  mode  helps  you monitor   
		bandwidht usage, CPU load, memory availability on your server   
		with tools like MRTG or RRD. "
